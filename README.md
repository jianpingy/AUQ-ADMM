# AUQ-ADMM
The code is for Adaptive Uncertainty-Weighted ADMM based on the paper "Adaptive Uncertainty-Weighted ADMM for Distributed Optimization" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.01089)

After loading all necessary functions from utils and ADMM classes in utils.py, AUQADMM.py and ADMMs.py, users can simply run main.py, without chainging any parameters, to obtain results.

More instructions have been written by comments in main.py.
